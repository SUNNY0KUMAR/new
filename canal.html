        <h2>A Monument Built on Human Bones</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>The White Sea-Baltic Canal</strong> stands as one of Stalin's most brutal construction projects. In 1931, you would have joined nearly 250,000 prisoners sent to carve a 227-kilometer waterway through the frozen wilderness of Karelia. Unlike modern engineering projects, you would have been given no machinery—only primitive tools and your bare hands to complete this massive undertaking.

            Each day would bring unimaginable hardship. You would awaken before dawn to begin digging in freezing conditions, using shovels, pickaxes, or even your bare hands when tools broke. The quota system ensured you would work until exhaustion—those who failed to meet daily targets received reduced rations, creating a deadly cycle of starvation and weakening that claimed countless lives.
        </p>


        <h3>The Daily Struggle for Survival</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primitive Methods:</strong> You would chisel through granite with hand tools and remove earth with wooden wheelbarrows. The lack of engineering equipment meant you had to create dams, locks, and berms through sheer human effort.</li>
            <li><strong>The Deadly Quota System:</strong> Your food rations depended entirely on your work output. Meeting only 75% of your quota meant receiving just 300 grams of bread—far too little to sustain the physical labor required.</li>
            <li><strong>Brutal Weather Conditions:</strong> You would endure temperature extremes, from freezing winters where the ground turned to iron, to summers plagued by mosquito swarms carrying malaria and encephalitis.</li>
            <li><strong>Summary Executions:</strong> Guards maintained "productivity" through terror. You would witness daily executions of those deemed "wreckers" or "saboteurs"—often just exhausted prisoners who could no longer keep pace.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>A Futile Monument</h3>
        <p>
            The canal's construction was completed in a remarkably short 20 months—a speed achieved through the expenditure of human lives rather than engineering excellence. After your grueling labor and the deaths of over 100,000 fellow prisoners, you would discover the bitter truth: the canal was only 3.5 meters deep, too shallow for most military and commercial vessels. The project you sacrificed everything for was largely symbolic, a propaganda victory built on a foundation of corpses.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The final insult came in the celebration.</strong> While Soviet propaganda glorified the canal as a triumph of socialist labor, those who survived its construction received no recognition. Instead, many were sent to new labor camps, their bodies broken but still useful to the state until death finally provided release.
        </p>

        <h3>The Legacy of Suffering</h3>
        <p>
            Today, the canal still operates, though it remains too shallow for major shipping. Its primary legacy is not as a waterway but as a testament to how your life—and the lives of hundreds of thousands of others—were considered entirely expendable in the pursuit of industrial and ideological goals. The canal's waters run deep with the memory of those who never left its banks.
