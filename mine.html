        <h2>The Gold Mines of Death</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Kolyma gold mines</strong>—a place where hope died first. These vast operations in Russia's far east became notorious as the deadliest section of the Gulag system. Here, in temperatures reaching -50°C, prisoners extracted the precious metals that fueled the Soviet economy, while their own lives were considered worthless.

        <p>
            Every day, prisoners were sent deep underground or into vast open pits, working with crude tools, surrounded by toxic gas and unstable tunnels. The work never stopped—not for blizzards, not for illness, not for exhaustion. The only reprieve came through death or the rare transfer to less deadly labor.
        </p>

        <div class="quote-box">
            <p>"We descended into the mine at dawn and emerged after dark. The air was poison, the cold was poison, the water was poison. Men died beside me daily, their bodies simply pushed aside as we continued to work. To stop digging was to stop breathing."</p>
            <div class="quote-author">— Mikhail Sorokin, mine survivor, 1949-1953</div>
        </div>

        <h3>Life in the Mines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Protection:</strong> Miners worked without safety equipment, using only basic hand tools. Protective gear was considered wasteful for prisoners. Lung diseases from rock dust were common and lethal.</li>
            <li><strong>Fatal Accidents:</strong> Cave-ins claimed countless lives. Gas pockets caused deadly explosions. Falling rocks crushed limbs. Medical care was minimal, with most serious injuries resulting in death.</li>
            <li><strong>Extreme Elements:</strong> In winter, prisoners worked in temperatures far below freezing. In summer, mosquito swarms were so thick they could suffocate a man who stopped moving. The wind in exposed areas had enough force to knock exhausted workers off their feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Punishment for Failure:</strong> Those unable to meet daily quotas received reduced rations, ensuring a downward spiral of starvation and decreased productivity. Guards had authority to execute "saboteurs" who consistently failed to meet production targets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mining Methods</h3>
        <p>
            The mining techniques used were primitive and dangerous. During winter, fires were lit to thaw the frozen ground. Workers would then quickly dig before the ground refroze. In summer, prisoners used picks and shovels to extract ore, which was then carried in heavy wooden boxes up crude ladders. The work was deliberately inefficient—human life was considered far less valuable than machinery.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Each day, the mines took their toll.</strong> Those who survived more than three years were rare exceptions. The psychological impact was as severe as the physical—the constant knowledge that one's life could end at any moment, and that no one would ever know or care where your body lay.
        </p>

        <h3>The Gold's Journey</h3>
        <p>
            The gold extracted by prisoners' labor was transported under heavy guard to processing facilities, then shipped to Moscow. It was used to fund industrialization and military expansion, or traded internationally for technology and goods. None of the wealth generated ever benefited those who died extracting it from the frozen earth.
