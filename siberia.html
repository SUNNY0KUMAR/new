        <li><strong>4:00 AM</strong> - Wake-up call</li>
        <li><strong>4:30 AM</strong> - Roll call regardless of weather</li>
        <li><strong>5:00 AM</strong> - Breakfast (thin gruel or bread)</li>
        <li><strong>5:30 AM</strong> - March to work site, often kilometers away</li>
        <li><strong>6:00 AM</strong> - Begin labor shift</li>
        <li><strong>1:00 PM</strong> - Brief break for lunch (soup with occasional fish or vegetables)</li>
        <li><strong>7:00 PM</strong> - End work and return to camp</li>
        <li><strong>8:00 PM</strong> - Evening meal (bread ration based on work performance)</li>
        <li><strong>10:00 PM</strong> - Lights out</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Survival Strategies</h3>
    <p>
        Those who survived the brutal conditions often relied on a combination of factors:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong social bonds</strong> with other prisoners, forming groups for mutual protection and resource sharing</li>
        <li><strong>Specialized skills</strong> that could earn placement in less physically demanding indoor work</li>
        <li><strong>Mental resilience</strong> and the ability to psychologically detach from immediate surroundings</li>
        <li><strong>Learning to navigate camp politics</strong> and developing relationships with those in positions of relative power</li>
        <li><strong>Adapting quickly</strong> to the unwritten rules and social hierarchies within the camp system</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Survival was never guaranteed.</strong> Even the strongest and most resilient prisoners faced a daily battle against cold, hunger, exhaustion, and disease. Those who survived often carried physical and psychological scars for the remainder of their lives. Many who were eventually released found themselves unable to reintegrate into society, forever marked by their time in the "frozen wasteland" of Siberian exile.

        <h2>The Frozen Wasteland</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Siberia</strong>—a vast, unforgiving territory spanning over 13 million square kilometers—became the Soviet Union's most notorious prison without walls. This remote region, characterized by extreme cold, dense forests, and sparse population, was transformed into a vast network of labor camps where millions were exiled as <strong>enemies of the state</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The journey to Siberian exile was itself a form of torture. Prisoners were crammed into <strong>cattle trains</strong> with little food, water, or sanitation. These transports, known as <strong>"Stolypin cars,"</strong> could take weeks to reach their remote destinations. Many prisoners died during transit from disease, exposure, or starvation before even reaching the camps.

        <h3>What Awaits You?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Extreme Cold</strong>: Temperatures regularly drop below -50°C, with winter lasting up to 9 months. Frostbite and hypothermia were common causes of death and disability. Prisoners worked outdoors regardless of temperature, stopping only when it fell below -40°C.</li>
            <li><strong>Backbreaking Labor</strong>: Prisoners were forced to work 12-14 hour days in mining, logging, railroad construction, or industrial projects. Work quotas were deliberately set beyond human capacity, ensuring most prisoners failed to meet them and received reduced rations.</li>
            <li><strong>Starvation Rations</strong>: Food allocations were tied to work output. The standard daily ration included 300g of black bread, thin soup, and occasional fish or porridge—providing only 1,200-1,800 calories despite the extreme physical demands and cold.</li>
            <li><strong>Inadequate Shelter</strong>: Barracks were overcrowded, unheated, and infested with lice and bedbugs. In some camps, prisoners had to build their own housing after arrival, sleeping outdoors until construction was completed.</li>
            <li><strong>Disease and Minimal Medical Care</strong>: Tuberculosis, scurvy, pellagra, and dysentery were rampant. Medical facilities were primitive, with few medications and untrained personnel.</li>
        </ul>
