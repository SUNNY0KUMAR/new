        <h2>What Was the Gulag?</h2>
        <p>The <span class="highlight">Gulag</span> was a vast network of forced labor camps established under the Soviet regime, existing primarily from the 1930s through the 1950s. The term "Gulag" is an acronym for "Glavnoe Upravlenie Lagerei," or "Main Camp Administration." These camps became the sinister machinery through which the Soviet state exercised control, punished dissent, and exploited forced labor for economic development.</p>

        <h2>Origins and Development</h2>
        <button class="accordion">Early Soviet Prison Camps (1918-1929)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>While the term "Gulag" wasn't used until later, the Soviet system of labor camps began shortly after the 1917 Revolution. Lenin's Red Terror campaign established concentration camps for class enemies, political opponents, and those deemed dangerous to the new Soviet state. By the mid-1920s, the camps were reorganized under the OGPU (secret police) and began to serve an economic function as well as a punitive one.</p>
            <p>The Solovetsky Special Purpose Camp, established on a former monastery in the White Sea, became the prototype for the later Gulag system, implementing harsh regimes of forced labor in remote locations.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Formalization Under Stalin (1929-1934)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>In 1929, as part of Stalin's First Five-Year Plan and rapid industrialization effort, the Soviet government formalized the camp system under the "Gulag" administration. The camps were envisioned as a way to isolate "enemies" while simultaneously exploiting their labor for economic development.</p>
            <p>During this period, massive infrastructure projects like the White Sea-Baltic Canal were constructed primarily using prisoner labor, with devastating human costs.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Great Purge (1936-1938)</h2>
        <p>During the late 1930s, <span class="highlight">Joseph Stalin</span> orchestrated a campaign of political repression known as the Great Purge or the Great Terror. This period saw <span class="highlight">over a million people arrested</span> on charges of being "enemies of the state," with many executed and countless others sent to the expanding network of labor camps.</p>
        
        <div class="quote-box">
            <p>"People were arrested... who were guilty of nothing... who were completely innocent, who were arrested only because it was necessary to confirm some quota... of arrests."</p>

                <h3>Expansion of the Gulag</h3>
                <p>The camp population swelled to over 1.8 million prisoners. New camps were rapidly constructed in the most remote regions of the Soviet Union.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Gulag Expansion During World War II</h2>
        <p>As World War II intensified, the Soviet Union <span class="highlight">used forced labor to fuel its war economy</span>. Gulag prisoners were sent to work in <span class="highlight">mines, railways, and weapons factories</span>, often in <span class="highlight">horrific conditions</span> with inadequate food, clothing, and shelter. Mortality rates peaked during this period due to the combination of harsh labor requirements and reduced rations.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Ethnic Deportations</h3>
        <p>During the war, entire ethnic groups accused of collaboration with the Germans were forcibly deported to special settlements administered by the Gulag. These included Volga Germans, Crimean Tatars, Chechens, Ingush, and several other nationalities.</p>

        <h2>Post-Stalin Era: The End of the Gulag</h2>
        <p>After Stalin's death in 1953, <span class="highlight">Nikita Khrushchev condemned the Gulag system</span> during his "Secret Speech" to the 20th Party Congress in 1956. This led to mass amnesties and the release of millions of prisoners. While the most brutal aspects of the system were dismantled, forced labor camps continued to exist in some form until the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

        <h2>Legacy and Memory</h2>
        <p>The Gulag system had profound impacts on Soviet society that continue to reverberate today. Millions of lives were destroyed, families separated, and communities devastated. The cultural and intellectual loss is immeasurable, as writers, artists, scientists, and thinkers were silenced through imprisonment or death.</p>
        
        <p>Works like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's "The Gulag Archipelago" and Varlam Shalamov's "Kolyma Tales" have provided powerful testimonies of life in the camps, ensuring this dark chapter of history is not forgotten.</p>

        <h3>Modern Memorialization</h3>
        <p>Today, museums and memorials across the former Soviet Union commemorate the victims of the Gulag system. The Gulag History Museum in Moscow and the Perm-36 Museum are among the institutions working to preserve this difficult history.</p>
